                            Our website is a participant in the Udemy Affiliates Program, an affiliate referral program designed to provide a means for sites to earn referral fees by advertising and linking to udemy.com.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Udemy is a global marketplace for learning and teaching online where more than 30 million students are mastering new skills and achieving their goals by learning from an extensive library of over 130,000 courses taught by expert instructors.

                            Finally, we intend to add products to the site in the future for which we will receive compensation for any purchases by site visitors. There are millions of such products on the web, but we include only those that we’ve researched and believe could benefit you in running online business.

                            Just to make clear, we provide links on the site to information such as information resources for which we receive no compensation. Our mission is to help our visitors find a rewarding career, but this is also very clearly a for-profit site and you should realize as much.
